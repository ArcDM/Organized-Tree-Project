# Organized-Tree-Project
Personal Java project to print out sorted binary trees

This program can take an integer as an argument, makes
an array populated with the integers one to the input
integer, and outputs all of the possible sorted binary
trees that can be made with that array.

Integers greater than 8 not fully evaluated for correctness.
Integers 20 and greater will cause an integer overflow
Integers 16 and greater will likely cause an "out of memory" error.

This program can also take a number of strings as an
argument, and output the sorted binary tree the array
of strings would create.

Some sequences of string will create output that look
odd, but are likely still displayed as intended.
